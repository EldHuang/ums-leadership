Through a combination of project-based learning, peer collaboration, and community involvement, students gain hands-on experience in organizing events, supporting school initiatives, and modeling positive behavior across campus. This course emphasizes communication, accountability, and service — essential qualities that prepare students not only for high school, but for meaningful leadership roles beyond the classroom.
